NSG
lets quickly start by creating NSG

NSGs come with predefined default rules to allow basic internal communication and internet access. These rules are prioritized lower than any custom rules.

1. Inbound Default Rules:

AllowVNetInBound : Allows all inbound traffic from within the same virtual network (VNet).
AllowAzureLoadBalancerInBound : Allows inbound traffic from the Azure Load Balancer for services such as health probes.
DenyAllInbound : Denies all other inbound traffic not explicitly allowed by higher-priority rules.

2. Outbound Default Rules:

AllowVNetOutBound : Allows outbound traffic to the same virtual network (VNet).
AllowInternetOutBound : Allows outbound traffic to the internet (if the outbound traffic is destined for a public IP).
DenyAllOutbound : Denies all other outbound traffic not explicitly allowed by higher-priority rules.

VNET PEERING
VNet Peering allows you to connect two or more VNets in the same or different Azure regions, where VM's can communicate with each other


b4 that there's Non-Transitive Peering - 
If VNet A is peered with VNet B, and VNet B is peered with VNet C, VNet A cannot communicate with VNet C unless there is an explicit peering between VNet A and VNet C.

Hybrid cloud

A hybrid cloud approach combines:
				On-premises infrastructure and
				Cloud services

1. Azure VPN gateway - is a Secure tunnel over the internet
Types:

Site-to-Site - This is a VPN connection between an on-premises network and Azure.

Point-to-Site - This allows individual devices (such as laptops or mobile devices) to securely connect to an Azure VNet

VNet-to-VNet - This is a VPN connection between an on-premises network and Azure.


2. Azure ExpressRoute

Private connection to Azure (not over public internet)

ExpressRoute is preferred where performance, security, Higher reliability and speed are essential. It provides direct connectivity through a service provider.
